## Please refer to the [documentation](https://monkeylang.org/) for syntax and features of Monkey Programming Language


## How to Use

## TODO
1. Adding the functionality of inputing a file and outputing the evaluated result to terminal
2. Creating a Compiler and Virtual Machine for my Monkey Interpreter
